# 🍰 Le Scone Project

A complete landing page developed during the **CSS with SASS Course** by [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/).  
This project demonstrates how to take CSS styling to the next level using **Sass** — making code more dynamic, efficient, and scalable.

## 🚀 About the Project

**Le Scone** is a fictional website for a classic patisserie, built to practice and apply advanced front-end concepts using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Sass**.  
The project emphasizes clean code, reusable structure, and responsive design.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Throughout the course, I explored key Sass features that help write professional and maintainable stylesheets:

- 🎨 **Variables** – to standardize colors, sizes, and typography  
- 🧩 **Mixins** – to reuse code blocks and apply consistent patterns  
- 🔁 **Loops and Functions** – to automate repetitive tasks  
- 🗂️ **Imports and Modular Organization** – to keep code clean and scalable  

### Course Overview

- 📘 **Part 1:** Fundamentals — installation, configuration, and Sass syntax.  
- 🧱 **Part 2:** Practical exercises — building real-world layouts and exploring the true power of Sass.  

## 🧩 Project Features

In **Le Scone**, I worked on developing a full landing page with:
- A **responsive and fluid grid layout**  
- **Modular Sass organization** (variables, mixins, and partials)  
- A **semantic and reusable structure**  
- A **design inspired by classic French patisserie style**, preserving its original visual essence  

This project highlights the importance of structure and automation in front-end development — showing how **Sass** can make code cleaner, more scalable, and much more enjoyable to maintain.
